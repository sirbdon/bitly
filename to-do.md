TO DO:

- Move all URL's to end of sentence (Twitter won't include in char count // wont show link in text)
- Show status updates in result window, replacing completely with result when done
- Output should be full body of email (Hi X .... Thanks, Brandon)
- Create client-side global function that can be called in console: Opens each bitly url in new window to check it
